### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
The topics we discussed helped me complete my assignments as for each lab, I learnt how to complete one milestone that was required for the project. I felt unprepared to complete the flexbox part of the project particularly because I hadn't digested all of the lab's information before attempting the third milestone. When I had finished the lab, I was able to complete the milestone.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
If I had more time, I would make my website more visually appealing and make my navigation bar have an smoother color transition. I would also embed a video to my website and attach my banner inside of it. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
Being able to make my Navigation bar stick when scrolling down as well as creating a box shadow under my contaier components to isoate their information and make them stand out more went well. One of my peers embedded a video with his banner in the center of it and that is defenitely something I wanted to do for my project as well.
